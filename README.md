<h3>What it basically does is that it iterates over all the recent problems in the problemset, sorts them with tags 'Accepted' and 'C++17', then it copies the code of the first person's submission,Selects the problem number, selects the language of submission, pastes it into the editor, submmits it, and wham!</h3>
<b>NOTE: </b>To change the number of iterations, change the while loop condition by adding an iterating variable for the number of times you want to iterate.
